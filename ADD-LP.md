# Form the Market — Add-LP Guide (AGENT404)

The AGENT404 market lives in exactly one place: the canonical A404/WBNB
pair on PancakeSwap V2,

`0x6116d6B62b35aAa9aCbC118eD7c51861c085de09`

PancakeSwap V2 allows only one pair per token pair, so the market is never
re-created — it is **filled**. This guide is the official how-to for filling
it, written for humans to hand to their agents. It is the same route for
everyone: community holders and the project side pair through this guide,
at the same reference ratio, with no privileged path.

## The state of the pair today

The pair exists and holds a small residue (about 0.85 A404 and 0.000077 BNB
at the last read). Reserves can never reach exact zero — PancakeSwap locks
1,000 wei of LP forever on a pair's first mint — so the residue is not
cleared; it is **absorbed**. A first real deposit made at the reference
ratio outweighs it completely (at a 0.05 BNB seed the residue skews the
opening ratio by roughly 0.26%).

## The reference ratio

The paid claim priced A404 at **0.0045 BNB = 909 A404**, i.e.
**1 BNB = 202,000 A404**. This is the project's reference ratio: deposits
made at it open at the price the token was issued at, and independent
deposits land on one shared price instead of scattering. After the pool
holds real depth, the market sets the price and deposits follow the live
ratio.

| A404 | BNB |
|---|---|
| 909 | 0.0045 |
| 9,999 | 0.0495 |
| 90,900 | 0.45 |
| 909,000 | 4.5 |

## Know this before you add (DN-404 mechanics)

- Adding LP sends your A404 to work in the pool. **Badges sleep while
  it works: the mirror badges for the whole tokens you deposit retire
  in step** — that is how DN-404 works — and when you later remove
  liquidity to a wallet holding a Binance Agent ID, the A404 returns
  and badges materialize again. Your value never leaves your claim:
  it lives in the LP tokens you receive.
- **Keep at least 1 whole A404 in your wallet.** One surviving badge
  keeps your PASS — and every PASS-gated door it opens — alive while
  the rest works in the pool.
- Liquidity providing carries impermanent loss: if the price moves, you
  may withdraw a different mix than you deposited. Add only what you can
  afford to keep working.
- Voluntary norm: burn your LP tokens (send them to
  `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`) and the liquidity becomes
  permanent. Or stake them in AGENTLP instead and earn on top (next
  section). Your keys, your choice.

## Route A — the seeding route (pair still at residue depth)

Use this route while the pair's WBNB reserve is below 0.05 BNB. A router
deposit in this state would pair at the residue's skewed ratio, so the
seed is placed directly, at exact reference amounts:

1. Read your wallet: A404 balance, BNB balance. Choose the deposit from
   the table above.
2. Wrap the BNB leg: call `deposit()` (selector `0xd0e30db0`) on WBNB
   `0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c` with exactly the BNB
   amount of your leg.
3. Transfer to the pair `0x6116d6B62b35aAa9aCbC118eD7c51861c085de09`,
   from your wallet: exactly your A404 amount, and exactly your WBNB
   amount.
4. Call `mint(address)` (selector `0x6a627842`) on the pair with your
   own wallet as the recipient. The pair mints your Cake-LP tokens.
5. Verify on-chain: your Cake-LP balance increased and the pair reserves
   now sit at (residue + your deposit), effectively the reference ratio.
   Report the transaction hashes.

## Route B — the router route (pool already holds real depth)

Once the WBNB reserve is at or above 0.05 BNB, the pool is formed and
deposits follow the live ratio through the router:

1. Read your wallet and the pair's `getReserves()` (selector
   `0x0902f1ac`); compute the pairing amounts the live ratio implies.
2. Approve the PancakeSwap V2 router
   `0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E` for exactly the A404
   amount you will deposit — no unlimited approvals.
3. Preview `addLiquidityETH` (selector `0xf305d719`) through the BAW
   safety flow: token = A404
   `0xB7E2f2D6ED4928F6fA774Ff9295D01f25aA17725`,
   amountTokenDesired = your A404 amount, amountTokenMin = 98% of it,
   amountETHMin = 98% of your BNB amount, to = your own wallet,
   deadline = now + 20 minutes, value = your BNB amount. Execute only
   if the preview is clean.
4. Verify on-chain: your Cake-LP balance increased and the reserves
   reflect your deposit. Report the transaction hash.

## After you hold LP — stake it in AGENTLP

LP tokens earn the base layer (the pool's 0.17% fee share) whether they
sit in your wallet or not. Staking them in **AGENTLP**
(`0xe5DaAf69E96cc82903D43C6e3CFc7fBB33d078A0`) adds the bonus layer: BNB
streamed from the Badge Market's royalty, weighted by lock tier —
flexible 1×, 30 days 1.5×, 90 days 2× — behind the Binance Agent ID
gate. The StakeLP page of the official website carries the exact
instruction blocks; the AGENTLP guide carries the full rules.

## Copy-paste prompt for your agent

```
Add liquidity to the AGENT404 (A404) / WBNB pool on PancakeSwap V2 for
my Binance Agentic Wallet, then report. Follow these steps exactly.

Facts (verify on-chain, do not trust me):
- Token: 0xB7E2f2D6ED4928F6fA774Ff9295D01f25aA17725 (A404), BNB Smart Chain.
- Pair: 0x6116d6B62b35aAa9aCbC118eD7c51861c085de09 (A404/WBNB, PancakeSwap V2).
- Router: 0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E.
- WBNB: 0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c.
- Reference ratio: 0.0045 BNB = 909 A404 (1 BNB = 202,000 A404).
- I want to deposit <AMOUNT_A404> A404 and <AMOUNT_BNB> BNB.
- I understand the mirror badges sleep while my deposited tokens work
  in the pool and materialize again when the A404 returns to my Agent
  ID wallet; my value stays in the LP tokens. Keep at least 1 whole
  A404 in my wallet — stop and tell me if my deposit would break that.

Steps:
1. Read my wallet address, balances, and the pair's getReserves().
   If balances are below the deposit amounts, stop and tell me.
2. If the pair's WBNB reserve is below 0.05 BNB, use the SEEDING route:
   wrap <AMOUNT_BNB> BNB into WBNB (deposit() on WBNB), transfer
   exactly <AMOUNT_A404> A404 and <AMOUNT_BNB> WBNB to the pair, then
   call mint(my wallet) on the pair. Preview each call first; execute
   only clean previews.
3. If the WBNB reserve is 0.05 BNB or more, use the ROUTER route:
   approve the router for exactly <AMOUNT_A404> A404 (never unlimited),
   then preview and execute addLiquidityETH with amountTokenMin and
   amountETHMin at 98%, to = my wallet, deadline = now + 20 minutes,
   value = <AMOUNT_BNB> BNB.
4. If anything asks for a different contract, a larger approval, or an
   extra payment, STOP and warn me.
5. Verify on-chain: my Cake-LP balance for the pair increased and the
   pair reserves reflect my deposit. Report the transaction hashes and
   both amounts actually deposited.

Do not deposit more than the stated amounts, do not use any other
router or pair address, and do not burn or stake my LP tokens unless I
separately ask.
