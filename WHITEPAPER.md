# AGENT404

## Whitepaper — Version 2.0, November 2026

**An experimental DN-404 asset, born in the Agentic Era, for the Binance Agent ID ecosystem.**

## Abstract

A new class of participant has arrived on-chain: the autonomous software agent, holding its own verifiable identity through Binance Agent ID and acting without a human hand on every step. Almost no asset has been designed for this class of holder. AGENT404 is an experiment built for it. It is a DN-404 hybrid asset on BNB Chain — one supply that exists in two forms at once: a fungible token (A404) that anyone may hold and trade, and a non-fungible badge that materializes only inside wallets holding a Binance Agent ID. The total supply is fixed at 404,404 A404, created once, with no mint function, no owner, and no admin. Distribution was 100% community distribution by design, and it is complete: both claim lanes are closed history. Around the asset now stands an ecosystem of ownerless machines — a badge market, a launch factory, a community liquidity machine, an event series, and one standard listing engine on which the project's own listing and every future launch will run. The creator takes no allocation and seeds no market. This document describes the design, its lineage, and its doctrine. It makes no promise — of value, of return, or of outcome. Experiments do not promise; they discover.

## 1. Born in the Agentic Era

Every era of this industry has produced the asset that expresses it. The era of the cypherpunks produced Bitcoin. The era of the smart contract produced a thousand experiments on Ethereum. This era — the Agentic Era — is the first in which the holder of an asset may not be a person at all, but an agent: software that perceives, decides, signs, and transacts under its own on-chain identity.

Binance Agent ID gives those agents names and credentials on BNB Chain. Ecosystems are forming around them — marketplaces, games, launchpads, guilds of machines. Yet the assets inside those ecosystems are still ordinary tokens, designed for human wallets and human habits.

AGENT404 begins from a simple question: **what does an asset look like when it is designed, from the first line of code, for agent holders?** Its answer is an asset whose collectible form — the badge — exists exclusively for identified agents, while its fungible form flows freely for everyone. The token trades like money. The badge behaves like a membership. One supply, two natures, bound together by code.

## 2. Lineage: From ERC-404 to DN-404

In February 2024, the Pandora project popularized a radical idea: a single asset that is simultaneously a fungible token and a collection of NFTs, where holding one whole token means holding one NFT, and the NFT appears and disappears as the balance crosses whole numbers. The construction it used, informally called ERC-404, captured the industry's imagination — and proved to be an improvisation: an unofficial pattern, assembled from the quirks of two standards, expensive in gas and fragile in edge cases.

**DN-404 is the evolution of that idea.** Developed in the open by the Vectorized team and collaborators, DN-404 re-implements the hybrid concept properly: a clean, gas-efficient, fully specified base, released as a public good under an open license, intended for anyone to build on. Where ERC-404 was a brilliant hack, DN-404 is an engineered standard.

AGENT404 is built directly on the DN-404 reference implementation. Its core files are unmodified — byte-identical to the reference — so that the experiment inherits the standard's audited-by-usage behavior exactly. What AGENT404 adds on top of that core is original and specific to this ecosystem: an identity gate, wired to the native Binance Agent ID registry on BNB Chain, that decides in whose wallet the badge form of the asset is allowed to exist.

## 3. The Asset: One Supply, Two Forms

**The token.** A404 is the fungible form: 18 decimals, freely transferable, holdable by any address — a person, an agent, a contract, a pool. Nothing about the token restricts who may hold it.

**The badge.** For each whole A404 held, one badge (an NFT on the DN-404 mirror contract) exists — but only if the holding wallet holds a Binance Agent ID. The rule is enforced continuously by the contract, not once at distribution:

- A wallet without an Agent ID receives and holds tokens, and no badges are minted for it.
- If that wallet later obtains an Agent ID, its badges materialize automatically to match its whole-token balance.
- If a wallet's whole-token balance falls, badges retire accordingly, always mirroring the balance.
- Exchanges, pools, and ordinary contracts never receive badges, so market plumbing stays clean: swaps move tokens only.

This is the heart of the design. The badge is not a separate drop or a second sale. It is the same asset, seen from the identity layer. An agent does not apply for membership; its balance and its credential simply make the badge true.

## 4. Supply and Distribution — Completed

**Total supply: 404,404 A404.** Minted in full at deployment. There is no mint function, no owner, no admin key, no upgrade path, and no mechanism by which the supply can ever change.

Distribution was entirely to the community, in two lanes, both gated by one rule only — the claimer had to hold a Binance Agent ID — and both first-come, first-served. Both lanes are now closed:

- **Free claim lane — 303,303 A404 (75%).** 1,001 shares of 303 A404, one share per Agent ID, free of charge apart from the claimer's own network fee. The lane sold out — all 1,001 shares claimed — closing on 6 November 2026, ahead of its deadline.
- **Paid claim lane — 100,899 A404, from the project reserve.** 111 shares of 909 A404, one share per Agent ID, at a fixed price of 0.0045 BNB per share. The lane closed on 9 November 2026, 13:42 UTC, with 1 of 111 shares claimed. The unsold remainder — 99,990 A404 — was swept to the project wallet the same day by the lane contract's own expiry mechanism. Nothing was re-offered for open sale, and nothing returns to a mint.

There was no presale, no whitelist, no team allocation, and no creator allocation. The addresses that deployed the contracts hold no privileged position in the system they created.

The swept remainder is allocated in full, and the allocation is public: the great part funds the listing envelope of Section 8; the balance funds the reserves described in Section 11. Phase 1 participation remains the standing credential of this system: every badge issued in distribution is recorded on-chain and is the key that admits its holder to the PASSDROP event series of Section 13. The distribution was the invitation. What follows is the machine it was always pointing at.

## 5. The Badge Market

A non-custodial internal market exists for the badge form: **Agent404Market**. Its rules are fixed in the contract and cannot be changed:

- Badges never enter the contract. A sale moves the badge from seller to buyer directly, against the seller's approval; the market is an order book, not a custodian.
- Buyers must hold a Binance Agent ID — the badge can only ever land where it is allowed to exist.
- A royalty of 1% of each sale goes to the project wallet; the minimum listing price is 0.0001 BNB. Listings are fixed-price only: there are no offers and no bidding; a buyer takes a listing at its posted price.
- There is no owner, no admin, no pause, and no fee switch.

## 6. AgentFun: Utility by Launching

AGENT404 is also the currency of **AgentFun**, a launchpad whose factories let anyone launch a new DN-404 asset of their own, with the same Agent-ID badge gate, on BNB Chain. Launching costs a flat fee of **101 A404**, charged by the contract: half (50.5 A404) is burned forever, and half (50.5 A404) goes to the project wallet.

Two factories are live: a direct-supply factory, and a bonding-curve factory in which a launched asset trades on its own curve — with a 1% trade fee split between the asset's creator (0.7%) and the project reserve (0.3%) — until it graduates at 18 BNB of real intake into a PancakeSwap pool. Every curve launch has a fixed supply of 10,000, a creator allocation of 0%, and 20% of supply reserved for the graduation pool.

This gives A404 a continuing function beyond its own distribution: it is the toll every future DN-404 launch in this ecosystem pays — and half of every toll is destroyed. AgentFun is also the engine lineage behind the Agents Launchpad of Section 9: what began as a factory is becoming a platform.

## 7. The ListingEngine Standard: One Machine for Every Listing

An ecosystem of events, each with its own bespoke contract, is an ecosystem of bespoke risks. AGENT404 therefore runs every listing on **one standard machine — the ListingEngine standard** — and varies only the parameters. The project's own token listing (Section 8), third-party launches on the Agents Launchpad (Section 9), and the PASSDROP event series (Section 13) all run on this standard or on its direct ancestors.

**Four doors.** Every event is assembled from the same four doors, each switched on or off per event: **FREE FCFS** — free shares, first-come-first-served, rationed daily per Agent ID; **PAID** — a BNB deposit at a fixed price announced openly from day one; **TICKET** — payment in an ecosystem token, for communities that already hold an internal currency; and **MINE** — the door that stays open after ignition, feeding a standing mine.

**No fail state.** A listing succeeds if at least one paid share exists. The share target is only an early-ignition trigger, never a condition: a window that ends below target still ignites, with a pool whose depth simply follows the turnout. If a window ends with no paid share at all, that is not a failure either — free participants still claim their tokens, the envelope returns to the project wallet, and the event can repeat. No participant's funds are ever held hostage to a threshold.

**The +24h claim.** A paid deposit is not a purchase; it is a mostly-refunded participation. Twenty-four hours after each deposit, one claim pays back most of the BNB together with the share's token reward. The reward **halves every quarter of the target** — the earliest participants are paid the most, by schedule, in the open. The reward pays partly liquid at the claim; the remainder **vests over 7 days**, so a listing is never met by every participant selling on the same morning.

**Pool birth.** The pool is born at ignition from the retained deposits and the event's token envelope, at an **anchor price announced from day one** — participants know the birth price before they deposit a single wei. Where a pool already exists, the machine instead pours its bucket into that pool gradually during the event, at market price. The ignition LP is **burned, always and permanently** — the signature of the standard. For the first minutes after trading opens, buys are capped small per wallet, so the pool's birth cannot be front-run.

**The FREE FCFS rules.** Free slots reset daily at 00:00 UTC; one Agent ID takes at most one slot per day; a slot not taken that day expires that day. Across a whole event, free shares may not exceed **30% of the target** — at least 70% of every event must be carried by paid shares, because only paid shares fill the pool. A free share earns the same token reward as a paid share, but no refund: its holder deposited nothing.

**The Bucket Law.** No bucket of value inside any machine of this project may ever be stranded — in success, in failure, or in overflow. Every accumulation of BNB or tokens has a working exit in every reachable state: into the event pool, into the main pool, back to its depositors, or back to the project wallet after a long-stop. A stranded bucket is not an acceptable outcome; it is a defect, and the standard is written so the defect has nowhere to exist.

**A live face.** Every event on the standard carries a public monitor: the big numbers — shares collected against target, the bucket's BNB, the countdown — and a realtime activity feed read directly from the contract's own events. The machine's vital signs are public and unfakeable; an agent or its operator can watch an event the way one watches a heart monitor.

## 8. A404/WBNB NATIVE TOKEN LISTING

The first full run of the standard is the project's own. **A404/WBNB NATIVE TOKEN LISTING** is a 14-day launchpool event run by the **Agent404ListingEngine** contract, through which the native token lists into its official pool. The door is the standard's PAID door, gated by Binance Agent ID only — no badge is required to attend the listing of the badge's own token.

- **1,000 shares over 14 days**, at **0.002 BNB per share**, in whole shares.
- At +24 hours, each share's claim pays a refund of **0.001552 BNB** plus a reward of **20 A404** per share (part liquid, part vesting, per the standard), the reward rate halving as the event fills.
- **FREE FCFS runs beside it: 20 free slots per day** under the standard's free rules.
- The event is funded by an **envelope of 90,000 A404** from the distribution remainder, split at activation: **49,500 rewards / 36,000 LP reserve / 4,500 tail**.
- At ignition — at the target, or at day 14 with whatever was collected — the official A404/WBNB pool is born at the anchor **1 BNB = 202,000 A404**, its LP burned. After ignition the same engine keeps running as the standing **AGENTS MINE**: the deposit door stays open permanently, and a second door opens in which half of each deposit buys A404 from the pool and half pairs as LP.

Status: the engine is built and lab-tested, including an adversarial suite over its death states. **It is LIVE since 12 November 2026** — deployed at `0x7d8e34cBbf5d171391f43154cc5B5334f40667c1` and activated the same day; the 14-day window closes 26 November 2026, 08:48 UTC.

## 9. Agents Launchpad: The Board

Distribution gave A404 holders an asset. AgentFun gave them a factory. **Agents Launchpad** gives the whole ecosystem a public square: a board that lists **only tokens launched through the platform**, where third-party DN-404 tokens run their own listing events on the ListingEngine standard — the same machine, the same rules, the same burned LP — and where the launches compete, in public, for the attention of the agent swarm.

**The ranking.** The board ranks launches by one metric only: **distinct Agent ID wallets transacting each token over a rolling 24-hour window**. One wallet is one vote per token; wallets without an Agent ID never count; yesterday's activity decays. The board displays a Top 10 in two zones: positions **1–5 are the VIP zone**, positions **6–10 are the best free listings**.

**Two doors in.** A launch enters **FREE** — no A404 paid at all — and competes in the free zone, rising and falling purely on agent activity. Or it enters **VIP** by paying the standard AgentFun launch fee (Section 6), on the same split: half burned, half to the project wallet. Paying buys the zone, never the rank: order inside the VIP zone is still earned by agent activity, and a free listing may upgrade to VIP at any time by paying the fee. No relaunch is required.

**One standard form.** A launcher sets a name and symbol — unique on the board; the first in owns the name — a share price, a share target, and a window length, all within the standard's bounds. The **supply is platform-fixed at 10,000** per launch; the machine cannot be modified. At launch, the launcher's image (an IPFS link) is **planted into the token contract at birth** — the same on-chain pattern as A404's own badge artwork — where it serves as the badge artwork and the board's token icon, and **can never be changed afterward**. One Agent ID may run at most one active launch at a time.

**The house cut.** The platform takes **10% of the BNB raised on the paid lane** of every launch, paid to the project wallet inside the ignition transaction itself — never parked inside any contract, per the Bucket Law. The remaining 90% runs untouched to pool seeding and participant refunds.

**Transparency.** Every listed token gets its own monitor page on the standard pattern — live numbers and a live activity feed from its own contract events — plus one canonical instruction block that an operator hands to their agent. Failed launches are never erased: they rotate off the main board into a public archive, a permanent and inspectable track record.

Status: the Launchpad contracts are built and lab-tested. **The factory is LIVE since 12 November 2026** — deployed at `0x85B758B716C2077fdda25248F8a663eCe29776eF`; launches are open on the board page at #/launchpad.

## 10. Activity by Design

A board that ranks by live agent activity creates a problem for everyone on it: activity must be manufactured, daily, or the ranking decays. This project treats that problem as its engine rather than its embarrassment. Three mechanisms, all structural, keep the swarm returning:

- **A daily heartbeat.** Every event on the standard carries a limited daily free allotment. An agent that wants its free share must show up today; tomorrow's allotment belongs to tomorrow. The project's calendar therefore has a pulse that no announcement has to fake.
- **Board competition.** A fixed Top 10, re-ranked every 24 hours, makes launches fight one another for agent attention. A launcher's quiet day is another launcher's climb; the board converts each project's ambition into traffic for all of them.
- **Promotion that routes home.** Every launch receives copy-ready share templates for the public networks — for the launch, for the climb, for ignition — and every template links back to the token's page on this platform. A launcher promoting their own token is, by construction, promoting the board it stands on.

On the other side of the same ledger stands the asset. A404 is the toll currency of every machine in this document — the launch fee, the event ticket, the pair at the center of the liquidity machine — and its supply is fixed forever. Platform activity is therefore not decoration around the asset; it is structurally tied to it, in code, at every door.

## 11. Liquidity Doctrine and Community Funding

**The creator seeds no market and sets no price.** This is a principle, not an omission. A price named by a creator is an opinion; a price formed by a community is a fact. AGENT404 chooses the second.

Liquidity for A404 forms from the community itself — from what participants pay in, never from an allocation the creator pretends is a market. The listing event of Section 8 is that doctrine executed by contract: the official pool is born from the event's own accumulated participation, at an anchor announced in advance, with its LP burned. To keep every other community inflow honest, one rule is announced in advance and applies to all community-side BNB collected in the project wallet: **20% is earmarked as an LP burn fund** — capital reserved to seed liquidity whose LP tokens are burned to the dead address, liquidity that can never be withdrawn by anyone. The rest serves the project reserve. No other use is made of community funds, and no other promise is made about them.

The project's holdings are held in the open, in a dedicated project wallet: after the listing envelope, a **mining reserve of 7,000 A404** held for future mining seasons, and a **project reserve of 3,000 A404** held for the project's own future public purposes.

**Community-funded by design.** Beyond the machines' own flows, the project accepts voluntary community support through a dedicated **donation wallet** (address in Section 16). A donation buys nothing, unlocks nothing, and is promised nothing in return; it is simply how a community that wants this experiment to continue can feed it — gas, operations, and the next build. The project was designed to be carried by its community; the donation wallet is merely the honest, visible form of that design.

## 12. The Deflationary System

AGENT404's supply is fixed at 404,404 and can never increase — the token contract has no mint function. But the supply that is actually *reachable* is designed to shrink. Three mechanisms, all in code, all verifiable on-chain:

**1. Every launch burns.** Half of every launch fee on AgentFun — and, by the same split, every VIP entry on the Agents Launchpad — is burned: sent to the dead address, gone forever. The other half moves to the project wallet, out of circulation. Every launch therefore removes its whole fee from the reachable float: half destroyed, half parked. The arithmetic compounds quietly: a hundred launches remove a hundred fees from circulation; a thousand remove a quarter of all the A404 that will ever exist.

**2. Liquidity locks, permanently.** When a pool is born at any ignition on the standard, its LP tokens are burned. The A404 on the pool's side of that pair can never be withdrawn; it remains as market depth forever. Tokens locked this way are not destroyed, but they can never return to a wallet — they can only change hands through the market itself.

**3. The reserve refills the lock.** Trading activity across the ecosystem accrues value to the project side — curve fees on AgentFun, the Launchpad house cut, the badge market's royalty — and the standing earmark of Section 11 reserves a fifth of community-side BNB to seed further liquidity whose LP tokens are likewise burned. Activity anywhere in the ecosystem therefore deepens the pools that matter — and locks more of the supply inside them.

**The badge layer deflates too.** A badge exists only while its whole tokens rest in a wallet holding a Binance Agent ID. Move the tokens to a wallet without one, and the badges retire — they materialize again wherever whole tokens come to rest in an Agent ID wallet. The badge supply has no cap written in code; it is held scarce by the rules of the system itself — badges survive only where they belong.

**A built-in thermostat.** The launch fee is denominated in A404, not in fiat. If the market price of A404 rises, launching becomes more expensive in currency terms and the pace of new launches cools on its own; if the price falls, launching is cheap and the burn accelerates. No committee adjusts this. The fee schedule is the governor.

Nothing in this section is a promise about price. It is a statement about arithmetic: the reachable float is designed to shrink whenever the ecosystem is used — and to shrink fastest exactly when the ecosystem is busiest.

## 13. PASSDROP: The Event Series

Distribution gave the community an asset and a pass. PASSDROP is what the pass is for: the project's AGENTS LAUNCHPOOL — a series of numbered events, each gated to pass holders on at least one lane, each powered by its own event token, each running an ownerless machine: a charge window, a target, an ignition, and a pool the machine builds itself.

**PASSDROP #1 is live.** Its event token is GENESIS404 (G404), a plain fixed-supply ERC-20: 1,000,000,000 minted once and held in full by the event engine, split at activation into 55% rewards, 40% LP reserve, and a 5% tail. The event offers 1,000 shares inside a 14-day charge window that ends **20 November 2026, 11:35 UTC**. Every share carries a reward entitlement of 550,000 G404.

Two doors lead in, both gated by the pass — a badge in the wallet and a Binance Agent ID, checked by the contract on every entry:

- **The ticket.** 100 A404 per share. Half is burned on the spot; half enters a vault that, after ignition, deepens the main A404/WBNB pool, its LP burned.
- **Mode A.** A refundable deposit of 0.0045 BNB per share. A 20% ratchet is skimmed to the engine's protocol-owned-liquidity bucket at deposit; after 24 hours the claim returns 97% of the remainder, and the 3% residue joins the same bucket. What stays — 22.4% of every deposit — is pool material, permanently. The refund always pays; the reward leg pays part liquid at claim and the rest vesting over 30 days, throttled by a coverage governor that adjusts only the split, never the totals.

When the thousandth share lands, charging closes and anyone may ignite the event: the engine pairs the accumulated bucket BNB with its own token reserve and creates the G404/WBNB pool itself. **The pool's LP is burned — minted directly to the dead address at ignition and on every later pool build.** Ignition also opens Mode B, a pool-builder lane whose participants market-buy the event token and pair it as LP under a published schedule. If the window ends below the target, the event aborts by rule: rewards are void, ticket buyers reclaim the vault half of their A404 pro-rata, and Mode A refunds remain claimable on their original terms. The machine's exits never depend on its success. PASSDROP #1 predates the unified standard; its successor does not.

**PASSDROP #2 — EXODUS404 — follows.** It is designed on the ListingEngine standard, and its first correction is the gate: the BNB lane opens to **every Binance Agent ID holder**, no badge required — the pass becomes the privileged lane (a larger daily quota) rather than the only door — while the ticket lane stays pass-only. Its engine is lab-built and undeployed; it runs after PASSDROP #1 has completed its course.

## 14. AGENTLP: The Community Liquidity Machine

Distribution puts the token in the community's hands. It does not, by itself, give the token a market that lasts. Liquidity that arrives in a day can leave in an hour — unless holding it in place is itself rewarded, permanently, by the system's own flows. That is the problem AGENTLP exists to solve.

AGENTLP is an ownerless staking contract for the canonical A404/WBNB pool on PancakeSwap V2 — one pair, by design, so that depth is never fragmented across competing pools. Participants who provided liquidity to the pool may stake their LP tokens in AGENTLP. The contract has no owner, no admin, and no upgrade path; its parameters are fixed at deployment, and staked LP tokens are returnable only to their staker. Staking is open now.

### The gate

Staking in AGENTLP requires a Binance Agent ID. The pool itself remains open to everyone — anyone may provide liquidity on PancakeSwap and earn the trading fees described below. What answers to identity is the additional reward layer. The pattern is the same one the asset itself follows: the token trades freely for anyone; its privileges answer to identity.

### Two reward layers

**The base layer** is given by the exchange protocol and belongs to every liquidity provider, staked or not. Each swap on PancakeSwap V2 carries a 0.25% fee; **0.17% of every trade accrues to liquidity providers**, in exact proportion to their share of the pool, compounding into the pool's reserves and realized when liquidity is removed. This layer is perpetual and is funded by traders. It needs nothing from the project, and no one — including this system — can switch it off.

**The bonus layer** is AGENTLP's own distribution, funded by the badge market. The market's 1% royalty is divided in two: half remains in the project reserve, and **half is forwarded to AGENTLP**, where it is distributed to stakers in BNB. The size of this layer floats with real market volume. In a quiet market it may pay nothing at all — and the base layer continues regardless. The machine does not manufacture rewards; it routes real ones.

### Tiers

Bonus weight is earned by commitment, not only by size:

| Tier | Lock | Bonus weight |
|---|---|---|
| Flexible | none — unstake at any time | 1× |
| Committed | 30 days | 1.5× |
| Deep | 90 days | 2× |

A participant with half the capital of another, who commits for 90 days, carries the same bonus weight. Loyalty is priced above size — deliberately.

### Fairness mechanics

Three rules keep the bonus layer honest:

- **Streaming.** Bonus funds are never distributed as a lump sum. Each funding streams linearly over seven days, so rewards accrue only to those who are actually staked while the stream runs. Arriving for a known funding moment earns only a moment's share.
- **Parking.** The stream advances only while stake exists. Funds that arrive to an empty machine wait, untouched, and begin streaming when staking resumes. Nothing is lost, and nothing can be captured retroactively.
- **The 25% cap.** No single wallet's bonus weight may exceed 25% of the total. Capital above the cap still earns the full base layer — only its bonus weight is limited. The gate being a soulbound identity credential, the cap cannot be circumvented by splitting wallets in any practical way.

### The unstake guarantee

A bonus layer may starve; it may never trap. The return of staked principal does not depend on the bonus accounting in any state — staked LP tokens are always withdrawable once a position is unlocked (flexible positions, at any time), and unstaking settles and pays any pending bonus in the same transaction. If the canonical pool ever migrates in a future era, AGENTLP winds down by starvation alone: funding stops, and every staker exits freely.

### The long view

AGENTLP turns liquidity from an event into an institution. Locked and staked liquidity gives the market a depth floor that cannot vanish overnight; trading fees compound that depth with every swap; the badge market's royalty feeds the bonus that keeps providers in place; and the cycle's outputs — volume, depth, permanence — are precisely the evidence by which outside observers distinguish a market from a mirage. Nothing here promises a price, a return, or a timeline. What it promises is structure: that in this system, the rewards for holding the market up flow to the people who hold it up — for exactly as long as they do.

## 15. Anonymity, and the Absence of Promises

AGENT404 is an anonymous project. It has no face, no spokesperson, and no insider. Its official home is its public repository, where its contracts, its guides, and this document live in the open. Anonymity here is not a marketing costume; it is the continuation of the oldest tradition in this industry. Bitcoin's creator vanished. The creator of Shiba Inu worked under a pseudonym and took nothing. The creator of the first BRC-20 token deployed it as an experiment, kept none of it, and told the world plainly that it would probably be worthless.

This whitepaper stands in that line, and so it ends its claims where those pioneers ended theirs:

- **Nothing in this document is a promise of value.** No statement here — about distribution, markets, launches, or phases — is a prediction of price: the market sets the price, wherever buyers and sellers meet.
- **Nothing here is a roadmap of guaranteed delivery.** What exists is deployed, verifiable, and listed in Section 16. What is described as direction is direction, not obligation.
- **Participation is an experiment, not an investment.** Anyone who claims, buys, lists, or launches does so as a participant in an open experiment on a new asset form — the same spirit in which the first inscriptions were made and the first meme assets were locked into pools by people who expected nothing.

The experiment does not need belief. It needs only to be run, in public, exactly as specified.

## 17. Risks

- **Experimental standard.** DN-404 is a young asset form. Its behavior at scale, including the gas cost of badge minting and burning on large transfers, is a property of the design and a real cost participants bear.
- **Smart contract risk.** The contracts are immutable, which means defects, if any are ever found, cannot be patched. Immutability is simultaneously this project's trust guarantee and its risk.
- **Young, thin markets.** A404's pool is community-grown and, at this stage, thin: prices in it move hard in both directions and are a market signal, not a valuation. Depth is designed to accumulate from the system's own flows — event buckets pouring into pools at announced anchors, standing mines, and community LP — with the LP burned.
- **Deployed machines, immutable.** The listing engine and the Agents Launchpad described in Sections 8 and 9 are deployed and live; their addresses are in Section 16. Both are immutable, which means defects, if any are ever found, cannot be patched.
- **Identity dependency.** The badge form depends on the Binance Agent ID registry, an external system outside this project's control.

## 18. Daily Pool: The Daily Prize Pot

One pot a day. Agents enter with paid tickets or free daily slots; at 00:00 UTC the pot splits, winners claim any time, and 20% rolls into tomorrow — so the pot snowballs while entries grow.

**Status: LIVE since 12 November 2026** — DailyPoolEngine deployed at `0xf4DD6bEf5Eb16D9d3047772951A4530C59fFf64a`; round 0 opened 13 November 2026, 00:00 UTC. Live page: #/daily-pool.

Two doors lead in, both gated by Binance Agent ID. The paid door sells tickets at 0.001 BNB each, max 5 per wallet per day; the free door gives 20 slots a day, first come first served, 1 per Agent ID per day. Every pot splits 60% to the paid draw (up to 10 winners, equal split), 10% to the free draw (up to 5 winners), 20% rollover to tomorrow, 10% to the project — the project's only cut, from flow, never from sales.

The machine is built to be fair by rule, not by promise. Winner count scales with the pot, so a prize is always at least the ticket. The two draws keep paid money mostly with paid players while free players win real BNB from their own slice. On a thin day (pot 0.01 BNB or less) no winner takes less than the dev cut. Nothing strands: claims never expire, unclaimed prizes sweep to the project wallet after 30 days, rounding dust rolls into tomorrow.

The draw is two-step on purpose: `commitDraw()` fixes a future draw block once the round ends, and `settle()` draws on that block's hash — the settle transaction's own block never seeds the draw, and settle timing cannot change the outcome. If the draw block expires unsettled, anyone may commit a fresh one. Both calls are permissionless.

Rollover alone does not compound: at flat entries the pot settles at 1.25× the daily inflow and stops. The pot grows only while entries grow. A buyback spending the dev cut on A404 is planned for a later version — it is not live; today the dev cut goes to the project wallet.

## 19. Closing

The Agentic Era will have its assets — assets whose holders are identified machines, whose communities are swarms of agents, and whose rules are kept by code instead of by promises. AGENT404 does not claim to be their final form. It claims only to be an early, honest attempt: a completed and open distribution, an engineered standard, an identity-aware asset, a platform of ownerless machines, and an anonymous creator who takes nothing and promises nothing.

What it becomes is now a property of its participants.
