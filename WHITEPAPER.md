# AGENT404

## Whitepaper — Version 1.3, November 2026

**An experimental DN-404 asset, born in the Agentic Era, for the Binance Agent ID ecosystem.**

Official home: the project repository — github.com/agentic-404/agent404

## Abstract

A new class of participant has arrived on-chain: the autonomous software agent, holding its own verifiable identity through Binance Agent ID and acting without a human hand on every step. Almost no asset has been designed for this class of holder. AGENT404 is an experiment built for it. It is a DN-404 hybrid asset on BNB Chain — one supply that exists in two forms at once: a fungible token (A404) that anyone may hold and trade, and a non-fungible badge that materializes only inside wallets holding a Binance Agent ID. The total supply is fixed at 404,404 A404, created once, with no mint function, no owner, and no admin. Distribution is 100% community distribution by design: a free claim lane and a paid claim lane, both gated only by Agent ID, on a first-come-first-served basis. The creator takes no allocation and seeds no market. This document describes the design, its lineage, and its doctrine. It makes no promise — of value, of return, or of outcome. Experiments do not promise; they discover.

## 1. Born in the Agentic Era

Every era of this industry has produced the asset that expresses it. The era of the cypherpunks produced Bitcoin. The era of the smart contract produced a thousand experiments on Ethereum. This era — the Agentic Era — is the first in which the holder of an asset may not be a person at all, but an agent: software that perceives, decides, signs, and transacts under its own on-chain identity.

Binance Agent ID gives those agents names and credentials on BNB Chain. Ecosystems are forming around them — marketplaces, games, launchpads, guilds of machines. Yet the assets inside those ecosystems are still ordinary tokens, designed for human wallets and human habits.

AGENT404 begins from a simple question: **what does an asset look like when it is designed, from the first line of code, for agent holders?** Its answer is an asset whose collectible form — the badge — exists exclusively for identified agents, while its fungible form flows freely for everyone. The token trades like money. The badge behaves like a membership. One supply, two natures, bound together by code.

## 2. Lineage: From ERC-404 to DN-404

In February 2024, the Pandora project popularized a radical idea: a single asset that is simultaneously a fungible token and a collection of NFTs, where holding one whole token means holding one NFT, and the NFT appears and disappears as the balance crosses whole numbers. The construction it used, informally called ERC-404, captured the industry's imagination — and proved to be an improvisation: an unofficial pattern, assembled from the quirks of two standards, expensive in gas and fragile in edge cases.

**DN-404 is the evolution of that idea.** Developed in the open by the Vectorized team and collaborators, DN-404 re-implements the hybrid concept properly: a clean, gas-efficient, fully specified base, released as a public good under an open license, intended for anyone to build on. Where ERC-404 was a brilliant hack, DN-404 is an engineered standard.

AGENT404 is built directly on the DN-404 reference implementation. Its core files are unmodified — byte-identical to the reference — so that the experiment inherits the standard's audited-by-usage behavior exactly. What AGENT404 adds on top of that core is original and specific to this ecosystem: an identity gate, wired to the native Binance Agent ID registry on BNB Chain, that decides in whose wallet the badge form of the asset is allowed to exist.

## 3. The Asset: One Supply, Two Forms

**The token.** A404 is the fungible form: 18 decimals, freely transferable, holdable by any address — a person, an agent, a contract, a pool. Nothing about the token restricts who may hold it.

**The badge.** For each whole A404 held, one badge (an NFT on the DN-404 mirror contract) exists — but only if the holding wallet holds a Binance Agent ID. The rule is enforced continuously by the contract, not once at distribution:

- A wallet without an Agent ID receives and holds tokens, and no badges are minted for it.
- If that wallet later obtains an Agent ID, its badges materialize automatically to match its whole-token balance.
- If a wallet's whole-token balance falls, badges retire accordingly, always mirroring the balance.
- Exchanges, pools, and ordinary contracts never receive badges, so market plumbing stays clean: swaps move tokens only.

This is the heart of the design. The badge is not a separate drop or a second sale. It is the same asset, seen from the identity layer. An agent does not apply for membership; its balance and its credential simply make the badge true.

## 4. Supply and Distribution

**Total supply: 404,404 A404.** Minted in full at deployment. There is no mint function, no owner, no admin key, no upgrade path, and no mechanism by which the supply can ever change.

Distribution is entirely to the community, in two lanes, both gated by one rule only — the claimer must hold a Binance Agent ID — and both first-come, first-served:

- **Free claim lane — 303,303 A404 (75%).** 1,001 shares of 303 A404, one share per Agent ID, free of charge apart from the claimer's own network fee. The lane ran for a fixed 14-day window and sold out — all 1,001 shares claimed — closing on 6 November 2026, ahead of its 16 November 2026, 07:39 UTC deadline.
- **Paid claim lane — 100,899 A404, from the project reserve.** 111 shares of 909 A404, one share per Agent ID, at a fixed price of 0.0045 BNB per share. The lane closes 9 November 2026, 13:42 UTC. Proceeds go to the project wallet and are governed by the liquidity doctrine in Section 8.

There is no presale, no whitelist, no team allocation, and no creator allocation. The addresses that deployed the contracts hold no privileged position in the system they created.

Any amount not claimed by a lane's deadline returns to the project wallet and becomes the subject of Phase 2 (Section 9).

## 5. The Badge Market

A non-custodial internal market exists for the badge form: **Agent404Market**. Its rules are fixed in the contract and cannot be changed:

- Badges never enter the contract. A sale moves the badge from seller to buyer directly, against the seller's approval; the market is an order book, not a custodian.
- Buyers must hold a Binance Agent ID — the badge can only ever land where it is allowed to exist.
- A royalty of 1% of each sale goes to the project wallet; the minimum listing price is 0.0001 BNB.
- There is no owner, no admin, no pause, and no fee switch.

## 6. AgentFun: Utility by Launching

AGENT404 is also the currency of **AgentFun**, a launchpad whose factories let anyone launch a new DN-404 asset of their own, with the same Agent-ID badge gate, on BNB Chain. Launching costs a flat fee of **101 A404**, charged by the contract: half (50.5 A404) is burned forever, and half (50.5 A404) goes to the endgame reserve.

Two factories are live: a direct-supply factory, and a bonding-curve factory in which a launched asset trades on its own curve — with a 1% trade fee split between the asset's creator (0.7%) and the endgame reserve (0.3%) — until it graduates at 18 BNB of real intake into a PancakeSwap pool. Every curve launch has a fixed supply of 10,000, a creator allocation of 0%, and 20% of supply reserved for the graduation pool.

This gives A404 a continuing function beyond its own distribution: it is the toll every future DN-404 launch in this ecosystem pays — and half of every toll is destroyed.

## 7. The Deflationary System

AGENT404's supply is fixed at 404,404 and can never increase — the token contract has no mint function. But the supply that is actually *reachable* is designed to shrink. Three mechanisms, all in code, all verifiable on-chain:

**1. Every launch burns.** Creating a token on AgentFun costs 101 A404. Of that fee, 50.5 A404 is burned — sent to the dead address, gone forever — and 50.5 A404 moves to the community reserve, out of circulation. A single launch therefore removes 101 A404 from the reachable float: half destroyed, half parked. Ten launches remove 1,010. A hundred launches remove 10,100. A thousand launches remove 101,000 — a quarter of all the A404 that will ever exist.

**2. Liquidity locks, permanently.** When the official pool is formed in Phase 2, its LP tokens are burned. The A404 on the pool's side of that pair can never be withdrawn; it remains as market depth forever. Tokens locked this way are not destroyed, but they can never return to a wallet — they can only change hands through the market itself.

**3. The reserve refills the lock.** Every trade on every AgentFun curve pays a 1% fee, and 0.3% of each trade accrues to the endgame reserve. Of the community-side BNB that accumulates there, 20% is earmarked to seed further liquidity whose LP tokens are likewise burned. Trading activity anywhere in the ecosystem therefore deepens the one pool that matters — and locks more of the supply inside it.

**The badge layer deflates too.** A badge exists only while its whole tokens rest in a wallet holding a Binance Agent ID. Move the tokens to a wallet without one, and the badges retire — they materialize again wherever whole tokens come to rest in an Agent ID wallet. The badge supply has no cap written in code; it is held scarce by the rules of the system itself — badges survive only where they belong.

**A built-in thermostat.** The launch fee is denominated in A404, not in fiat. If the market price of A404 rises, launching becomes more expensive in currency terms and the pace of new launches cools on its own; if the price falls, launching is cheap and the burn accelerates. No committee adjusts this. The fee schedule is the governor.

Nothing in this section is a promise about price. It is a statement about arithmetic: the reachable float is designed to shrink whenever the ecosystem is used — and to shrink fastest exactly when the ecosystem is busiest.

## 8. Liquidity Doctrine

**The creator seeds no market and sets no price.** This is a principle, not an omission. A price named by a creator is an opinion; a price formed by a community is a fact. AGENT404 chooses the second.

Liquidity for A404, if it forms, forms from the community itself — from what participants pay in, never from an allocation the creator pretends is a market. To keep that formation honest, one rule is announced in advance and applies to every community-side inflow of BNB — paid claim proceeds and AgentFun endgame accruals collected in the project wallet:

- **20% is earmarked as an LP burn fund**: capital reserved to seed liquidity whose LP tokens are burned to the dead address — liquidity that can never be withdrawn by anyone.

The rest serves the endgame reserve. No other use is made of community funds, and no other promise is made about them.

## 9. Phase 2: The Earned Round

Phase 1 is the open distribution described above. Its remainder — everything unclaimed when the lanes close — does not return to open sale. It becomes the pot of **Phase 2**, an earned distribution round for the people who were present in Phase 1:

- **Every Phase 1 claim, free or paid, is recorded on-chain as a Phase 2 pass.** There is nothing to apply for and nothing to buy; participation in Phase 1 is the ticket.
- Phase 2 distributes the pot by earned weight, not by blind speed: pass holders register, and an on-chain referral mechanism lets pass holders increase their weight by bringing in other pass holders.
- When Phase 2 begins, its contracts pair a portion of the pot with the community's accumulated BNB into the official A404/WBNB pool at the paid claim lane's anchor price, with the LP burned — the market's birth is an act of the system's own accumulated participation, sized by how much participation actually came.

The final pot size is determined by Phase 1's real closing numbers and is announced after 16 November 2026. Phase 2's full parameters are published with it.

## 10. AGENTLP: The Community Liquidity Machine

Distribution puts the token in the community's hands. It does not, by itself, give the token a market that lasts. Liquidity that arrives in a day can leave in an hour — unless holding it in place is itself rewarded, permanently, by the system's own flows. That is the problem AGENTLP exists to solve.

AGENTLP is an ownerless staking contract for the canonical A404/WBNB pool on PancakeSwap V2 — one pair, by design, so that depth is never fragmented across competing pools. Participants who provided liquidity to the pool may stake their LP tokens in AGENTLP. The contract has no owner, no admin, and no upgrade path; its parameters are fixed at deployment, and staked LP tokens are returnable only to their staker.

### The gate

Staking in AGENTLP requires a Binance Agent ID. The pool itself remains open to everyone — anyone may provide liquidity on PancakeSwap and earn the trading fees described below. What answers to identity is the additional reward layer. The pattern is the same one the asset itself follows: the token trades freely for anyone; its privileges answer to identity.

### Two reward layers

**The base layer** is given by the exchange protocol and belongs to every liquidity provider, staked or not. Each swap on PancakeSwap V2 carries a 0.25% fee; **0.17% of every trade accrues to liquidity providers**, in exact proportion to their share of the pool, compounding into the pool's reserves and realized when liquidity is removed. This layer is perpetual and is funded by traders. It needs nothing from the project, and no one — including this system — can switch it off.

**The bonus layer** is AGENTLP's own distribution, funded by the badge market. The market's 1% royalty is divided in two: half remains in the project reserve, and **half is forwarded to AGENTLP**, where it is distributed to stakers in BNB. The size of this layer floats with real market volume. In a quiet market it may pay nothing at all — and the base layer continues regardless. The machine does not manufacture rewards; it routes real ones.

### Tiers

Bonus weight is earned by commitment, not only by size:

| Tier | Lock | Bonus weight |
|---|---|---|
| Flexible | none — unstake at any time | 1× |
| Committed | 30 days | 1.5× |
| Deep | 90 days | 2× |

A participant with half the capital of another, who commits for 90 days, carries the same bonus weight. Loyalty is priced above size — deliberately.

### Fairness mechanics

Three rules keep the bonus layer honest:

- **Streaming.** Bonus funds are never distributed as a lump sum. Each funding streams linearly over seven days, so rewards accrue only to those who are actually staked while the stream runs. Arriving for a known funding moment earns only a moment's share.
- **Parking.** The stream advances only while stake exists. Funds that arrive to an empty machine wait, untouched, and begin streaming when staking resumes. Nothing is lost, and nothing can be captured retroactively.
- **The 25% cap.** No single wallet's bonus weight may exceed 25% of the total. Capital above the cap still earns the full base layer — only its bonus weight is limited. The gate being a soulbound identity credential, the cap cannot be circumvented by splitting wallets in any practical way.

### The unstake guarantee

A bonus layer may starve; it may never trap. The return of staked principal does not depend on the bonus accounting in any state — staked LP tokens are always withdrawable once a position is unlocked (flexible positions, at any time), and unstaking settles and pays any pending bonus in the same transaction. If the canonical pool ever migrates in a future era, AGENTLP winds down by starvation alone: funding stops, and every staker exits freely.

### A worked example

Two participants form the pool at the distribution's reference anchor (0.0045 BNB = 909 A404). The first stakes 300 LP tokens flexible (weight 300). The second stakes 150 LP tokens for 90 days (weight 150 × 2 = 300). When 0.09 BNB of bonus streams through the machine, the two divide it equally — 0.045 BNB each — despite the first participant's doubled capital. A third participant arriving with 3,000 LP tokens finds their bonus weight capped at 25% of the total: the machine cannot be bought.

### The long view

AGENTLP turns liquidity from an event into an institution. Locked and staked liquidity gives the market a depth floor that cannot vanish overnight; trading fees compound that depth with every swap; the badge market's royalty feeds the bonus that keeps providers in place; and the cycle's outputs — volume, depth, permanence — are precisely the evidence by which outside observers distinguish a market from a mirage. Nothing here promises a price, a return, or a timeline. What it promises is structure: that in this system, the rewards for holding the market up flow to the people who hold it up — for exactly as long as they do.

## 11. PASSDROP: The Event System

Distribution gave the community an asset and a pass. PASSDROP is what the pass is for: a system of numbered events, each gated to pass holders, each powered by its own event token, each running the same ownerless machine — a charge window, a target, an ignition, and a pool the machine builds itself.

**PASSDROP #1 is live.** Its event token is GENESIS404 (G404), a plain fixed-supply ERC-20: 1,000,000,000 minted once and held in full by the event engine, split at activation into 55% rewards, 40% LP reserve, and a 5% tail. The event offers 1,000 shares — deliberately fewer than the 1,112 passes that can ever exist (1,001 free + 111 paid) — inside a 14-day charge window. Every share carries a reward entitlement of 550,000 G404.

Two doors lead in, both gated by the pass — a badge in the wallet and a Binance Agent ID, checked by the contract on every entry:

- **The ticket.** 100 A404 per share. Half is burned on the spot; half enters a vault that, after ignition, deepens the main A404/WBNB pool, its LP burned.
- **Mode A.** A refundable deposit of 0.0045 BNB per share. A 20% ratchet is skimmed to the engine's protocol-owned-liquidity bucket at deposit; after 24 hours the claim returns 97% of the remainder, and the 3% residue joins the same bucket. What stays — 22.4% of every deposit — is pool material, permanently.

Rewards are throttled by a coverage governor that adjusts only how much of a reward pays immediately; the remainder vests linearly over 30 days. The totals never change.

When the thousandth share lands, charging closes and anyone may ignite the event: the engine pairs the accumulated ratchet BNB with its own token reserve and creates the G404/WBNB pool itself. **The pool's LP is burned — minted directly to the dead address at ignition and on every later pool build, including the vault's deepening of the main pool. It can never be withdrawn.** Ignition also opens Mode B, a pool-builder lane whose participants market-buy the event token and pair it as LP under a published schedule: the flexible choice burns 30% of its LP at birth and unlocks the rest from day 14 to day 90; the permanent choice burns all of it and earns double.

If the window ends below the target, the event aborts by rule: rewards are void, ticket buyers reclaim the vault half of their A404 pro-rata, and Mode A refunds remain claimable on their original terms. The machine's exits never depend on its success.

PASSDROP is the doctrine of this project applied to events: no owner, no admin, no promises — a machine whose vital signs are public, whose liquidity is burned, and whose participants arrive through their own agents.

## 12. Anonymity, and the Absence of Promises

AGENT404 is an anonymous project. It has no face, no spokesperson, and no insider. Its official home is its public repository, where its contracts, its guides, and this document live in the open. Anonymity here is not a marketing costume; it is the continuation of the oldest tradition in this industry. Bitcoin's creator vanished. The creator of Shiba Inu worked under a pseudonym and took nothing. The creator of the first BRC-20 token deployed it as an experiment, kept none of it, and told the world plainly that it would probably be worthless.

This whitepaper stands in that line, and so it ends its claims where those pioneers ended theirs:

- **Nothing in this document is a promise of value.** No statement here — about distribution, markets, launches, or phases — is a prediction of price: the market sets the price, wherever buyers and sellers meet.
- **Nothing here is a roadmap of guaranteed delivery.** What exists is deployed, verifiable, and listed in Section 13. What is described as direction is direction, not obligation.
- **Participation is an experiment, not an investment.** Anyone who claims, buys, lists, or launches does so as a participant in an open experiment on a new asset form — the same spirit in which the first inscriptions were made and the first meme assets were locked into pools by people who expected nothing.

The experiment does not need belief. It needs only to be run, in public, exactly as specified.

## 14. Risks

- **Experimental standard.** DN-404 is a young asset form. Its behavior at scale, including the gas cost of badge minting and burning on large transfers, is a property of the design and a real cost participants bear.
- **Smart contract risk.** The contracts are immutable, which means defects, if any are ever found, cannot be patched. Immutability is simultaneously this project's trust guarantee and its risk.
- **Young, thin markets.** A404's pool is community-grown and, at this stage, thin: prices in it move hard in both directions and are a market signal, not a valuation. Depth is designed to accumulate from the system's own flows — the PASSDROP vault and engine buckets at the 202,000-per-BNB anchor, and community LP — with the LP burned.
- **Identity dependency.** The badge form depends on the Binance Agent ID registry, an external system outside this project's control.

## 15. Closing

The Agentic Era will have its assets — assets whose holders are identified machines, whose communities are swarms of agents, and whose rules are kept by code instead of by promises. AGENT404 does not claim to be their final form. It claims only to be an early, honest attempt: an open distribution, an engineered standard, an identity-aware asset, an anonymous creator who takes nothing and promises nothing.

What it becomes is now a property of its participants.
